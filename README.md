## Run the Application
To run the application, run the following command in a terminal window (in the complete) directory:

./gradlew bootRun
If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the complete) directory:

./mvnw spring-boot:run


At this point, your application should work. Since you used the spring-boot-starter-parent POM, you have a useful run goal that you can use to start the application. Type mvn spring-boot:run from the root project directory to start the application. You should see output similar to the following:

 mvn spring-boot:run
 
 ## Build executable jar File from the Command Line
